# Who let you in here?

**Welcome to my website where I occasionally share my notes, thoughts and tutorials about Open Source, BSD and GNU/Linux system administration, and programming. Iâ€™m a lover of all things Gaming, Geek, Linux, Unix and Tech; preferably all at once. So come and join me on my journey of consciousness where I talk about things that pique my interest or may be of interest to you.**

**You're here, so you may as well dig around; you can probably find SOMETHING here of interest. In the end, I guess, all (personal) webpages fill the same goals. It's not about artistic integrity, or disseminating information, or self-expression, or advertising, or ego, or purity, or sanctity, or individualism, or any number of other words. It's about... well... I dunno. Something, anyway. It's about something. Yes. That's it. Something. And in honor of the pursuit of that something, here's my page.**
