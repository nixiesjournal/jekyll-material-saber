My name is Nixie and this is my website where I occasionally share my notes, thoughts and tutorials about Open Source, BSD and GNU/Linux system administration, and programming. I'm a lover of all things Gaming, Geek, Linux, Unix and Tech; preferably all at once. So come and join me on my journey of consciousness where I talk about things that pique my interest or may be of interest to you.
